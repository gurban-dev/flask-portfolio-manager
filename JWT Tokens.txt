JWTs or JSON Web Tokens provide a way to securely transit
information between a client and a server.

JWT Flow:
A user logs in with their credentials.

The API receives the request and sends it to the server.

The server generates a token containing the user ID.
The server signs the token with a secret key so the client
cannot tamper with it.

The client stores the token usually in memory and sends it
with each request in the Authorisation header.

When the server receives future requests, before granting
access it verifies the token's signature and checks whether
it has expired.
