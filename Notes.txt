How does JWT (JSON Web Token) function?
A user logs in, sending a request to the server.
The server generates a JWT token.

The client side stores the token through localStorage
or cookies.

Every API request includes a token in the header.

The server validates the token without database lookups
because it is faster.

Architecture:
Layer 1: Client Layer (What Users See)
Layer 2: API Layer (Request Handler)

Use cases:
CSV uploads: Process 10 000 rows without blocking
PDF generation: Create monthly reports asynchronously
Email notifications: Send portfolio alerts
Scheduled jobs: Recalculate ESG scores daily
